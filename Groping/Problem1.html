        <p>During health emergencies, timely information can allow governments to make decisions that save lives. 
            But in <span class="highlight">2020</span>, Mongolia faced challenges in getting some of the evidence it needed.

            <p> “At the beginning of the <span class="highlight">COVID-19 pandemic</span>, it was crucial to determine which variants were

                at Mongolia’s <span class="highlight">National Center for Communicable Diseases (NCCD)</span>. However, the country’s 
                laboratories were not equipped to use the most accurate, up-to-date methods, so samples 
                were sent overseas for genomic sequencing.
